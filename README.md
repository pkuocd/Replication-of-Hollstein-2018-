The paper "How Aggregate Volatility-of-Volatility Affects Stock Returns" by Fabian Hollstein and Marcel Prokopczuk investigates the role of aggregate volatility-of-volatility (the volatility of market volatility) in explaining stock returns. Using the VVIX, an index measuring the implied volatility of the VIX (volatility index), the authors demonstrate that aggregate volatility-of-volatility carries a negative risk premium. Specifically, stocks with higher sensitivities to innovations in aggregate volatility-of-volatility exhibit lower average returns, suggesting investors demand compensation for bearing this risk.

In this replication project, we replicated the main results of the paper with similar significance levels (Tables 4 and 5), but did not fully replicate the original regression coefficients. While the deviations for most coefficients were within 10\%, some exhibited larger discrepancies.
